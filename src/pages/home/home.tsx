                        <strong>King Shan</strong> is the king of the planet <strong>Lengaburu</strong>, in the distant distant galaxy of Tara B. After the recent war with neighbouring planet Falicornia, King Shan has exiled the Queen of Falicornia for 15 years. <strong>Queen Al Falcone</strong> is now in hiding. But if King Shan can find her before the years are up, she will be exiled for another 15 yearsâ€¦.
